# [Optional] Take down your system

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Cement your know-how on what it took to set up your system.

---

## Additional motivation

Notice that this is an **Optional** assignment. However, I still recommend that you do it. Maybe the group could take out a day to sit together and do this.

The course requirement is that the system must be running during the exam. 

Since the exam could be much later than the last lecture and because of limited amount of credit it might be a necessity. 

But even if credit is no problem, you could still try to recreate the entire setup from scratch in parallel to the system that you have running.

Doing it a second time is how you go from vaguely remembering and forgetting over time to mastery.
