## Service Level Agreement

You must create a service level agreement. It must be published. 

**Advice**: As highlighted in the links above, don't overpromise; especially not for new systems. Professional SLAs incorporate a compensation mechanism that offers payouts. These payouts escalate in accordance with the duration of downtime surpassing the agreed-upon thresholds.

The SLA should contain:
 
* **Service Scope**: Defined services, features, and processes.

* **Performance Metrics**: Key performance benchmarks (uptime, response time).

* **Response and Resolution**: Expected times for incident handling.

* **Security Measures**: Defined protections.

* **Compliance Standards**: Required regulations.

* ~~Compensation Scheme: Penalties for not meeting metrics.~~

Compensation scheme is crossed out for obvious reasons, but kept to show that professional SLAs usually include it.
