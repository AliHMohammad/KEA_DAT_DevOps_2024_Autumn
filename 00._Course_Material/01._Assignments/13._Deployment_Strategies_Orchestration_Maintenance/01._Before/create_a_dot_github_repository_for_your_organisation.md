**Motivation**: Create a nice frontpage for your organisation.

## Explanation

A .github repository is a unique type of repository. Its `README.md` will be displayed on your organisation's profile page.

You can also define a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` that become valid on all repositories in your organisation.

Here is an article to get you started and help you understand the different files that can go in there:

It misses the `SECURITY.md` file. Here is the work of a former KEA student that has it all, including an alternative way of defining the README.md inside of the `profile` folder:

Assess which of the files you need and create them.
