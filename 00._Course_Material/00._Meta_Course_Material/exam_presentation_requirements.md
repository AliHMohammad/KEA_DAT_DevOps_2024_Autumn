# Exam Presentation Requirements

## The Format

This is taken directly from the source of truth, [Kea Katalog](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/3050407/2024-2025):

> Eksamen starter som et gruppeoplæg/-præsentation, der varer i 5 minutter per studerende. Herefter individuel eksamination i 20 minutter inkl. votering.

Remember that the allotted time always includes getting into the room, setting up and getting out. I recommend that you try to connect your computer to the projector in the exact room ahead of the exam. Maybe have a backup and have the demo ready on more than one computer.

# Advice for the group presentation

Avoid reading if possible. Each student only has to memorize less than 5 minutes.

Focus on demoing rather than presenting through slides. This is the first time censor and I see the final product and your job is to sell us on the technical aspects of the entire system.

You can safely assume that we have read the report. This is another case for demoing, which is something the report can't do.

Try to avoid slides. If you want to show diagrams, you could have them open in a tab.

# Advice for the individual examination

Study based on the learning goals in the semester plan. 

Have the following ready:

- The exam report
- Relevant tabs open for the website, monitoring, CI/CD pipeline, documentation, etc.
- The mandatories
