Remember to check the learning goals for the course and make sure that you have achieved them.

It's a good measure of my expectation for the exam.

# Debois' definition of DevOps


> *It's taken me 10-plus years to come up with my own one-line definition of DevOps:*

> ***"DevOps is whatever you do to bridge friction created by silos, and all the rest is engineering."***

> *And so, if you're doing technology just for the technology and you're not trying to overcome some friction of the human kind of siloing or group siloing or information siloing or whatever, then you're just doing the engineering part and you're not, in my opinion, doing the DevOps part."*

- Patrick Debois

# DevOps is people too

3 keys to an organization's success (PPT framework):

1. People

2. Process

3. Technology

We've considered at all three in this course.

Never sacrifice one for the other.

# Counterpart to the first half of the course

It is unsustainable to constantly push for productivity. 

Don't narrow your focus to the short-term. Otherwise, you will end up neglecting the health for your team.

> "*High productivity is masking an exhausted workforce*"

[Source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work)

Avoid measuring it with a single metric such as number of commits. 

SPACE framework: Measures productivity in terms of:

* **S**atisfaction and well-being
* **P**erformance
* **A**ctivity
* **C**ommunication and Collaboration
* **E**fficiency and flow.

# Is DevOps even the end goal?

DevOps offers a solution to common problems. 

While you have to ask yourselves if you were DevOps you should also ask if you did what was best for your team in the context of the course.

---

# The big question

Were you DevOps? Were I DevOps? What does it mean to be DevOps?

DevOps is not a goal. It's about continuous improvement. I hope you can use this in your general life.
