# Installing kubectl and Minikube

**Kubectl**: the command line tool for interacting with Kubernetes.

**Minikube**: creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine (only for local development and testing).


```bash
$ brew install kubectl minikube
```

```powershell
$ choco install kubernetes-cli minikube
```
---

# Starting Minikube

You have to sepcify the driver.

Possible drivers are: `Docker`, `Hyperkit`, `KVM2`, `Parallels`, `Podman` `VirtualBox`, `VMware Fusion`, `VMware Workstation`

```bash
$ minikube start --driver=docker
```

**Note**: There are limitations to using the `Docker` driver but since we already have it installed, we will use it.

Check the status:

```bash
$ minikube status
```

You can always stop minikube with:

```bash
$ minikube stop
```

---

# Limitations of the Docker driver

Beware that using Docker as the driver outside of Linux means that ingress will not work. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76470764/why-i-cant-get-access-to-app-from-browser-with-kubernetes-minikube)

That's why it's recommended to use virtualization drivers. But on Apple Silicon this might be a challenge.

Windows users might make it work with the `Hyper-V` driver:

```powershell
$ minikube start --driver=hyperv
```

---

# SSH into it

SSH into it:

```bash
$ minikube ssh
```

The default user name for minikube is `docker`, even if you are not using the `docker` driver.

---

# Check the services

After ssh'ing into the minikube, you can check the services:

```bash
$ docker ps
```

You will recognize these services from the previous graph. 

---

# Using `kubectl` to interact with Minikube

`kubectl` is a command line tool, external to Minikube, which allows us to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
```

```bash
$ kubectl get services
```

---

# Namespaces and pods

We haven't created any pods yet:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

Check the namespaces:

```bash
$ kubectl get namespaces
```

When we listed pods we only did so in the default namespace.

Check the pods in the `kube-system` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

---

# Let's run a pod

Let's pull the `Nginx` image from DockerHub and run it in a pod:

```bash
$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
```

Check the pods:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

```bash
$ kubectl describe pod nginx
```

---

# Deleting the pod

The problem is that running a new pod with `kubectl run` only creates a single pod which goes against the idea of Kubernetes. 

Instead, we want to create a deployment which will create a replica set of pods.

First, let's delete the pod:

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod nginx
```

---

# Create a deployment

Pull the `Nginx` image from DockerHub and create a deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

Check the deployments:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
```

Check the pods:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

---

# Exposing the pod

We cannot access the pod from outside the cluster. The IP address of the pod is internal.

There are multiple ways to expose the pod:

1. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port.

2. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

3. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.

4. **ExternalName**: Maps the service to the contents of the `externalName` field.

---

# Exposing the pod using 

First delete the existing service:

```bash
$ kubectl delete service nginx
```

And then expose the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
```

With `minikube` the URL will be mapped to localhost and the port can be retrieved with:

```bash
$ minikube service nginx --url
```

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Deployments</h1>
</div>

---

# Creating a deployment

Let's create a deployment for a simple Express server running on port `3000` (image in my account):

```bash
$ kubectl create deployment k8s-web-hello --image=andlocker/k8s-web-hello
$ kubectl expose deployment k8s-web-hello --port=3000 --type=NodePort
```

Get the URL:

```bash
$ minikube service k8s-web-hello
```

The first IP address will be the same as:

```bash
$ minikube ip
```

---

# Scaling the deployment:

```bash
$ k scale deployment k8s-web-hello --replicas=4
```

---

# Cleaning up

Delete the service (`svc`):

```bash
$ kubectl delete svc k8s-web-hello
```

Or delete all:

```bash
$ kubectl delete all --all
```

---

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Kubernetes Dashboard</h1>
</div>

---

# Deploying the dashboard with Minikube

It's very easy to do with minikube:

```bash
$ minikube dashboard
```

Outside of Minikube it is a bit more complicated and requires login credentials/token.

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Decleratively working with Kubernetes</h1>
</div>

---

# Imperative vs Declarative

We were working imperatively before by typing commands into the terminal.

Now we will work declaratively by creating a `yaml` file which describes the desired state of the cluster.

---

# Create a deployment

Create a `deployment.yaml` file.

In `deployment.yaml` type "Deployment" and press `tab` to get the template then:

| Replace Key     | Replacement Value               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| ​                |                                 |
| `name` (x4)     | `k8s-web-hello`                 |
| ​                |                                 |
| `image`         | `andlocker/k8s-web-hello:latest`|
| ​                |                                 |
| `containerPort` | `3000`                            |

The containerPort is 3000 because my Express server is running on port 3000.

---

# Apply the deployment

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Check the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
```

Check the amount of pods:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
```

---

# Add more replicas

Edit the `deployment.yaml` file and add the `replicas` field under the "top-level" `spec` key:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 4
```

Reapply and check the pods.

We want it to run as a service so that we can access it from the browser.

But, it is not running as a service yet. Check `$ kubectl get services`.

---

# Create a service

We want to also create a service to expose the pods as a network endpoint. We will create a `LoadBalancer` service.

Create a `service.yaml` file.

Type "Service" and press `tab` to get the template.

| Replace Key          | Replacement Value        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `name`               | `hello`          |
| `app`                | `k8s-web-hello`          |
| `port`               | `3000`   |
| `targetPort`         | `3000`    |
| `nodePort` [Optional]​​​​​​​​​​| `32000`    |
| `type` (under `spec`)| `LoadBalancer`           |

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

The `targetPort` in the serviced must be the same as the `containerPort` in the deployment.

---

# Apply the service

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

Check the service:

```bash
$ kubectl get services
```

Open the service in the browser:

```bash
$ minikube service k8s-web-hello
```

---

# Cleaning up

Delete the deployment and service:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml -f service.yaml
```

---

# Combine the two files

It is standard to combine a deployment and a service into one file. We will call it `deployment_service.yaml`.


1. Paste the deployment. 

2. Add `---` after it.

3. Paste the service.

This makes it easier to apply.

---

# Cleaning up

Delete the deployment and service:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml -f service.yaml
```

---

# Combining the two files

You can combine the two files into one by pasting the content and separating them with `---`.

A generic name could be `deployment_service.yaml`. It can also be named after the app.

*Cam you apply the new file, open the URL in the browser and then delete it all?*

---

# Solution - Apply the combined file and take it down

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deployment_service.yaml
$ minikube service k8s-web-hello
$ kubectl delete -f deployment_service.yaml
```

---

`deployment_service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: k8s-web-hello
spec:
  replicas: 4

# What is Helm?

* [**Helm Charts**](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0&sort=relevance&page=1): public and private repositories for Kubernetes manifests.

* **Templating engine**: allows for dynamic values in the manifests. Define values in a `values.yaml` file. 
  *  Example: Define service name in one place and invoke it with `{{ .Values.serviceName }}`.

* **Release Management**: Versioning, configuration, upgrades and rollbacks.

# Install Helm

https://helm.sh/


```bash
$ brew install helm
```

```powershell
$ choco install kubernetes-helm
```

Example command that (downloads, names, deploys and creates the resources to the default configured Kubernetes cluster):

```bash
$ helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```
