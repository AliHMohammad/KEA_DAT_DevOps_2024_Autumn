# Story from the trenches


> "*An even more interesting example of resilience at  Netflix  was  during  the  “Great  Amazon  Reboot  of  2014,” when nearly 10% of the entire Amazon EC2 server fleet had to be rebooted to apply an emergency Xen security patch.*

> *When  we  got  the  news  about  the emergency EC2 reboots, our jaws dropped. When we got the list  of  how  many  Cassandra  nodes  would  be  affected,  I  felt ill.”*

> *Then  I  remembered  all  the Chaos  Monkey  exercises  we’ve  gone  through.  My  reaction was, ‘Bring it on!’*"

\- Christos  Kalantzis  of  Netflix  Cloud  Database Engineering

Find exact data on how well they performed on Page 316 in the DevOps Handbook.

> "*Even more surprising, not only was no one at Netflix working active incidents due to failed Cassandra nodes, no one was even in the office — they were in Hollywood at a party celebrating an acquisition milestone.*"

# Let's create our own "chaos monkey"

In `keasmonkey.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while true
do
    echo "Choosing a pod to kill..."

    PODS=$(kubectl get pods | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}')
    POD_COUNT=$(kubectl get pods | grep -v NAME | wc -l)

    if [ "$POD_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "No pods found. Exiting loop."
        break
    fi

    K=$(( (RANDOM % POD_COUNT) + 1))

    TARGET_POD=$(kubectl get pods | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}' | head -n ${K} | tail -n 1)

    echo "Killing pod $TARGET_POD"
    kubectl delete pod $TARGET_POD

    sleep 1
done
```

---

# Running it

First apply the deployment_service:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deployment_service.yaml
```

Then run the chaos monkey (on Windows try Git Bash):

```bash
$ ./keasmonkey.sh
```

Open the dashboard:

```bash
$ minikube dashboard
```

# What is fake about the previous example?

*What made our test useless?*

---

# What are we testing for?

Our little test basically tests Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities.

If our infrastructure was more complex and pods depended on each other, we would gain more insight into how our system behaves under stress.

# Game days

A game day is a practice where a team simulates a failure on a system to test its resilience. It happens in a predetermined time and all hands are on deck to solve problems that arise.

Game days in actual companies end up resulting in a handful of suprising failure that no one was able to predict. 

It's all about uncovering these failure points.

# Game days at Amazon

Amazon is known for its game days.

> "*a service is not really tested until we break it in production.*"

\- Jesse Robbins, known as the "Master of Disaster" at Amazon


---

# Game days are scary but they provide us unexpected lessons ahead of disaster

Example:

> "*When the data centers ran out of diesel for the backup generators, no one knew the procedures for making emergency purchases through the supplier, resulting in someone using a personal credit card to purchase $50,000 worth of diesel.*"

\- Kripa Krishnan, Google's Disaster Recovery Program (DiRT). 

Other examples at DiRT teaches us that:

* "*It's just about how to solve problems. Sometimes it's about knowing who to call.*"

# Health checks in Docker containers

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck

```yaml
    healthcheck:
      test: curl localhost:8080/available_languages | grep ', "en",'
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 13s
```

# Avoid the cargo cult mentality that pervades our industry

Many companies jump on the idea of implementing high-availability, fault-tolerant and highly scalable systems.

In Denmark most companies do not need this but there is a tendency to look at what the big companies are doing. 

You are in no way expected to implement today's topics for your project. The goal is to inform you about the possibilities and how to solve certain challenges, may they present themselves to you.

**Counter point**: The blog post - [You have built a Kubernetes](https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2024/you-have-built-a-kubernetes/) - details how in an attempt to avoid using Kubernetes and through custom parameterized shell scripts and Docker Compose, a worse version of Kubernetes was built.
