# Fault tolerance - One solution: Redundancy

Solution to the single-point-of-failure problem. Creates resilience. 

*The human body is resilient. Give examples of redundancy.*

<details> 
  <summary>The human body</summary>
   The human body has two kidneys, two lungs, two eyes, two ears, and so on. If one fails, the other can take over.

# Scalability

Designing for scalability -> accommodate increased demand. 

- **Vertical scaling**: increase the capacity of a single server

- **Horizontal scaling**: add more servers

[Example](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling/)

# Congestion

A bottleneck in the system where the capacity is exceeded.

The solution: load balancing

Example: [Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)

# Advanced orchestration platforms

- **Kubernetes**

- **Docker Swarm** *(deprecated and added as a plugin to Kubernetes instead)*

- **OpenShift**

- **Mesos**

- **Nomad**
